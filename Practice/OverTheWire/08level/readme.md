## Solution

After logging in, there is the same `data.txt` file from last challenge. This time the prompt says to find the line of text that only appears once. This challenge stumped me for a little bit.

I tried to see if I could find something about uniqueness in grep but couldn't find anything. I looked into the `sort` and `uniq` commands from the commands I may need section. I found that `sort` just sorts the lines of a text file and uniq reports or omit's repeated lines. More importantly `uniq` has a `-u` which only prints the unique lines.

Putting those together the command is: `sort data.txt | uniq -u`

The resulting password is: `EN632PlfYiZbn3PhVK3XOGSlNInNE00t`
