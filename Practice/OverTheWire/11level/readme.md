## Solution

After logging into the server, there's another `data.txt` but this time the prompt says it has been rotated 13 positions. This sounds like [rot13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13) to me.

Rot13 is part of a simple Caesar cipher where each of the characters has been rotated according to their ascii value by 13 values.

Rot13 can be decoded using [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) or after a [quick google search](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5442436/using-rot13-and-tr-command-for-having-an-encrypted-email-address) using the command `tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'`.

Either way the result is the same:

```bash
bandit11@bandit:~$ cat data.txt | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'
The password is JVNBBFSmZwKKOP0XbFXOoW8chDz5yVRv
