## Solution

After logging into the server, there's another `data.txt`. This time after catting it, its a short base64 encoded string.

Base64 can be decoded on [Cyberchef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) or on the command line using `base64 -d data.txt` or `cat data.txt | base64 -d`.

Either way the resulting answer and password is:

```bash
bandit10@bandit:~$ base64 -d data.txt 
The password is 6zPeziLdR2RKNdNYFNb6nVCKzphlXHBM
