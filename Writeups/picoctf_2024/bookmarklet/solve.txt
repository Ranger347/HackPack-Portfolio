After going to the website, I find there is a bookmarklet for me to try. I researched what a bookmarklet was, and it turns out there is a way to inject javascript code into the url of a bookmark and then when you try to go to the website, it prints the contents of the javascript on the page. Although since it was just javascript, you can also throw it into the console and it will alert you with the flag.
