# Month of March

## Week 1: March 1

### Recap

Today's meeting was going over some writups for the [bitsctf](../../Writeups/bitskrieg_2024/bitskrieg_2024.md) we did two weeks ago and some other binary exploitation tools to use. There was a talk about gdb, ghidra,pwntools, and angr.

### What I learned

I already knew a good bit about gdb but I didn't know anything about gef (a better gdb tool) so that was interesting. I knew what ghidra was and a small amount about how to use it since I am in the computer security class at NCSU, but I learned a little about it. I had no idea how to use pwntools or angr so I learned a fair amount about what they do and how to use them. I hope to be able to use both of those tools in future ctf challenges I participate in.

## Week 2: March 8

### Recap

Wasn't able to attend today. Had to do some writeups for my computer security class.

### What I learned

In my other class I took a deeper dive into pwntools.
