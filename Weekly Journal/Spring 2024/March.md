# Month of March

## Week 1: March 1

### Recap

Today's meeting was going over some writups for the [bitsctf](../../Writeups/bitskrieg_2024/bitskrieg_2024.md) we did two weeks ago and some other binary exploitation tools to use. There was a talk about gdb, ghidra,pwntools, and angr.

### What I learned

I already knew a good bit about gdb but I didn't know anything about gef (a better gdb tool) so that was interesting. I knew what ghidra was and a small amount about how to use it since I am in the computer security class at NCSU, but I learned a little about it. I had no idea how to use pwntools or angr so I learned a fair amount about what they do and how to use them. I hope to be able to use both of those tools in future ctf challenges I participate in.

## Week 2: March 8

### Recap

Wasn't able to attend today. Had to do some writeups for my computer security class.

### What I learned

In my other class I took a deeper dive into pwntools.

## Week 3: March 15

Nothing this week. Spring break :)

## Week 4: March 22

### Recap

This week we participated in [picoCTF](https://picoctf.org/). I did some of the challenges and writeups can be found [here](../../Writeups/picoctf_2024/). I also was having trouble with my dual booted kali partition on this computer so some of my writeups were lost but I'm going to recover what I can and redo the things I was able to solve.

#### What I learned

I learned some about the git commands and about a random notify-true html parameter inside a section tag.

## Week 5: March 29

### Recap

We went over picoCTF writups today. I went over my writeup for [Time Machine](../../Writeups/picoctf_2024/time_machine/) in front of the club and was going to go over [WebDecode](../../Writeups/picoctf_2024/webdecode) but we ran out of time.

#### What I learned

One of the other members went over the [SansAlpha](../../Writeups/picoctf_2024/sansalpha/) writeup which was pretty cool because it used the ? for the wild card characters, which I haven't used in a long time and sort of forgot about.
