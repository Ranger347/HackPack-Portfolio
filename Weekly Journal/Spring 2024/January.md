# Month of January

## Week 1: January 12

### Recap

Today was the first meeting back from the winter break. Gabriela asked the members what kind of things they wanted to learn in the coming semester. We played [OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org) for the remainder of the time. A few of the challenges I solved can be found [here](/Practice/OverTheWire).

### What I learned

I learned about the uniq and sort commands on the Linux terminal.

I learned about how to write quick for loops in bash. File can be found [here](/Practice/OverTheWire/bash_commands.txt).

## Week 2: January 19

### Recap

This week was an informational meeting where presentations were shared about metasploit, file structures, and python packages for CTF challenges. I also helped two of my friends set up kali linux virtual machines on their computers using VirtualBox and the Kali Linux imager file for virtual machines.

### What I learned

I learned a good bit about python scripting for CTF challenges. I know python scripting is not one of my strong suits when it comes to CTF challenges so I tried to pay extra attention. I tried to copy some of the files that were on the slides. Some of it I was able to copy and other parts I was not. However, I learned about the [requests](python_requests.py) and [connect](python_connect.py) packages in the urllib module.

I also learned about the `tree` command, which can be used to list all the recursive files in a directory in a tree based structure. After using it for a little while and realizing literally everything has a million directories in it, I also found a `tree -L` which can be used to specify how far down a tree directory to go.  

One final thing is I learned about the `tldr` package. It is similar to manual pages (`man`) but it is more simple and to the point with more easy to read examples of how to use a program. It isn't a replacement to `man` because it doesn't include system calls but it is very useful for bigger programs.

## Week 3: January 26

### Recap

Today's meeting began early (3pm instead of 4:30pm) when I was in class, so I could not attend for the majority of the meeting; however, I was able to come for the latter half of the meeting after some of the other people left. I was informed during this meeting we were going to participate again this year in [MitreCTF](https://mitre-engenuity.org/growing-impact/ectf-embedded-capture-the-flag/) so I went ahead and signed up for it with the team. For the other time, we participated in the [Real World CTF](https://realworldctf.com/) as a group. We looked through some of the challenges, but most of them we struck out on.

#### What I learned

When working on the Real World CTF I tried to do multiple of the challenges, but didn't have much luck with any of them because they were just outside of the things I knew how to do. So I learned what I don't know, so hopefully when the writeups come out, I'll be able to look at them and learn what I was confused about today. :)
