# Month of April

## Week 1: April 5

### Recap

Today's meeting was to prepare for the HackPack CTF next week :). Michael gave a presentation on hacking LLM's because apparently all the challenges have some sort of LLM / AI twist to them. Should be an interesting CTF.

### What I learned

I learned a lot about prompt injection. Since it's such a new field of hacking, it is interesting to see things that may or may not work. I also got a copy of [Michael's presentation](./AI%20Prompt%20Injection%20Talk.pdf).

## Week 2: April 12

### Recap

This week was HackPackCTF 2024. I am CSC 405 Computer Security as a class here at NC State, so I was required to participate as a grade. My writeups can be found [here](../../Writeups/hackpackctf_2024/). I had a lot of fun trying to figure out how to hack LLM's and prompt inject to find different things.

### What I learned

I learned a ton about how to hack LLM's and prompt inject. You should go check out my writeups :).

## Week 3: April 19

### Recap

Last meeting, and officer announcement. There was also a presentation on a couple of the challenges from the hackpack ctf so that was pretty cool.

### What I learned

Not much learned this week. Just had fun playing games with some cool people :)

## Week 4: April 26

### Recap

Finals week, no meeting.
