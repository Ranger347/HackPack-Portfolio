# Month of February

## Week 1: February 2

### Recap

Today's meeting was an informational meeting about Web tools we can use in CTF tournaments. There were presentations from some of the members. These presentations were about commix, burpsuite, sublist3r, and sqlmap. Commix is a tool used for command injection. Burpsuite is a suite used for capturing and intercepting packets before it is sent to the server. sublis3r is a tool used to find other subdirectories of a website. Finally, sqlmap is a tool used for automating sql injection on vulnerable servers.

### What I learned

I haven't heard of any of these tools other than burpsuite before today, so it is nice to learn some new tools to automate different vulnerabilites.
