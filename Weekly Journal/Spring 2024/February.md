# Month of February

## Week 1: February 2

### Recap

Today's meeting was an informational meeting about Web tools we can use in CTF tournaments. There were presentations from some of the members. These presentations were about commix, burpsuite, sublist3r, and sqlmap. Commix is a tool used for command injection. Burpsuite is a suite used for capturing and intercepting packets before it is sent to the server. sublis3r is a tool used to find other subdirectories of a website. Finally, sqlmap is a tool used for automating sql injection on vulnerable servers.

### What I learned

I haven't heard of any of these tools other than burpsuite before today, so it is nice to learn some new tools to automate different vulnerabilites.

## Week 2: February 9

### Recap

Today's meeting was an interesting meeting where we learned about how to pick locks. There were multiple different diagrams to learn how locks work and a couple of examples from members who had the appropriate tools and experience. I also downloaded [juice-shop](https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop) (which was too big to push), a server with many vulnerabilites to exploit, but I didn't do any of the exploits before we started talking about locks.

### What I learned

I already had a pretty good understanding of how locks worked from last year when we had the lock picking talk, but it was interesting to see all the different types of locks brought by different members. One of the people who was giving the talk was an apprentice locksmith so it was pretty cool to get to hear how he explained how to pick certain locks and how the locks are different but share similar pin and spring structures.

## Week 3: February 16

### Recap

Today's meeting was a CTF Day :) We played [bitskrieg ctf](https://ctf.bitskrieg.org/) and I completed some of the challenges. Writeups can be found [here](../../Writeups/bitskrieg_2024/bitskrieg_2024.md).

## Week 4: February 23

### Recap

There was no meeting today due to the [Cybersecurity Symposium](https://www.nc-pace.org/2024symposium).

#### What I learned

I was not able to attend the first day, but I attended the second day and met lots of lovely people. I also learned a little bit about possibly preparing myself for a leadership role in cybersecurity and how to better prepare myself for my career. Its not always all about the hacking :)
